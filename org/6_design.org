  I think I am struggling to understand exactly what a "Databases"
  project means. Other than putting the data in a database, what should
  I be looking to do?

  #+begin_quote
  It only looks so simple because we've been dealing with 1-table
  2-column databases, which require no planning and no maintenance.

  "Creating a database" includes practical and theoretical understanding
  of the database system (DB + infrastructure) from conception (what
  data, who will use, when, why etc.) through implementation (which
  flavor, which OS, which network, which speed, which size) to
  maintenance.

  The next DataCamp course is on another section of the DB
  conception/planning stage.

  The scope of the problem was included in the lecture (video) by Prof
  Baesens on databases a few weeks ago - we reviewed it in class -
  cp. the 3-layer-model.

Creating a database for a course project generally implies several key
activities aimed at *designing*, *implementing*, and *managing* a *structured*
collection of data that is both *efficient* to use and *scalable*.

This process often encompasses a variety of tasks from initial
conception to final implementation, including but not limited to the
following:

1. INITIAL PLANNING AND DESIGN:
   - *Requirement Analysis:* Understanding the data needs and the
     operations that will be performed on the database.
     #+begin_quote
     Example: The database should contain available, relevant
     information about the foods and the types of foods in all of the
     Seinfeld TV show episodes.
     #+end_quote
     #+begin_src sqlite :db ../data/foods.db :results output :column 
       SELECT name FROM foods LIMIT 1; /* example food */
       SELECT name FROM food_types LIMIT 1; /* example food type */
       SELECT name FROM episodes LIMIT 1; /* example episode */              
     #+end_src
                    
   - *Conceptual Design:* Creating a high-level model of what data will
     be stored and how the entities within the database will interact
     with each other, often represented through an Entity-Relationship
     (ER) diagram.

     #+attr_html: :width 700px: 
     [[../img/foods_erd.png]]
     #+end_quote

2. IMPLEMENTATION:
   - *Logical Design:* Transforming the conceptual model into a logical
     model, which includes defining the specific structures and
     relationships between the data in a way that can be implemented
     in a database management system (DBMS).
     #+begin_src sqlite :db ../data/foods.db :results output :header :column 
       .schema foods_episodes /* bridge table between `foods` and `episodes` */
     #+end_src

   - *Physical Design*: Deciding on the physical storage of data,
     considering performance optimization through indexing,
     partitioning, and choosing the appropriate storage format.
     #+begin_quote
     - How to translate entities into physical tables (e.g. `foods`
     - What attributes to use for columns of the physical tables (e.g. `name` of food)
     - Which columns to define as keys (for cross-table queries)
     - What indexes to define on the tables (to speed up queries)
     - What views to define on the tables (stored queries)
     - How to denormalize the tables (to avoid costly joins)
     - How to resolve many-to-many relationships (bridge tables)
     #+end_quote
          
3. DATABASE CREATION
   - *Schema Definition:* Using Data Definition Language (DDL) commands
     to create the database schema, which includes tables, views,
     indexes, and other database objects.
     #+begin_src sqlite :db ../data/foods.db :results output :header :column 
       .schema
     #+end_src

   - *Data Insertion:* Populating the database with initial data using
     Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands or bulk insert tools.
     #+begin_example sqlite
     INSERT INTO "episodes" VALUES(0, NULL, 'Good News Bad News');
     #+end_example
     
4. TESTING AND EVALUATION
   - *Functionality Testing*: Ensuring that the database functions
     correctly, including data insertion, querying, updating, and
     deletion.
   - *Performance Testing*: Evaluating the database performance under
     different loads and optimizing as necessary.

5. DOCUMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE
   - *Documentation:* Creating comprehensive documentation that covers
     the design decisions, schema details, and usage instructions for
     future reference and maintenance.
   - *Maintenance Plans:* Establishing procedures for regular
     maintenance tasks such as backups, performance tuning, and
     security updates.

6. DASHBOARD CREATION
   - Select UI (user interaction) design framework (e.g. R Shiny)

   - Build dashboard with database connection to customer
     specifications.

- In March, you will also study the basics of database design with two
  chapters of the "[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/database-design][Database Design]]" course on DataCamp.
- The Seinfeld 'food' SQLite database will serve as our example, and I
  will work it up into a sample project that you can use as
  springboard.
