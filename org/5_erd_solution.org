* Sample solution lecturer/course/student db design

- All relationships are subject to *business rules*. E.g. at least one
  student may have to be enroled in a course, or a lecturer may only
  be allowed to give a certain number of lectures - or reversely, a
  lecture may have to have at least one lecturer assigned to it.

- Because business rules change, the relationship structure of the
  database may also change. The schema, reflected in the entity
  relationship diagram, reflects this ([[https://editor.ponyorm.com/user/birkenkrahe/Team/designer][source diagram at ponyorm]]).
