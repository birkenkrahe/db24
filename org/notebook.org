** TODO Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** TODO DataCamp review: Relational databases

*** Corrections (nit-picking)

- SQL is NOT an acronym for anything, not even "Structured Query
  Language" (that's just a mnemonic): when Codd proposed his
  relational model, he also proposed a language called DSL/Alpha to
  manipulate the data. A group at IBM built a simplified version of
  that language and called it SQUARE, which eventually led to a
  language called SEQUEL, which was finally shortened to SQL
  (Beaulieu, 2021:23).

- The number of fields (columns, features) is not set when the
  database is created but when the table containing the columns is
  created.

** TODO [[file:1_history.org][History of databases]] (and their types)

- Watch on [[https://youtu.be/KG-mqHoXOXY][YouTube]] (5:39 min) - Computer History Museum, 2019

  #+caption: Which of these founders has nothing to do with databases?
  [[../img/founders.png]]

- DB are an old human interest (information is always gathered)

- DB development happened in close "combat" with companies and
  operating systems (market and a hardware aspect to it)

- Dominant language is SQL - in connection with relational DB

- Codd's 12 rules = everything you need to know about relational
  DB design (these rules scale extremely well)

- There are MANY different types of DBMS (see e.g. "7 types of DB" by
  fireship)

- We'll be installing SQLite, too, for local SQL experimentation
