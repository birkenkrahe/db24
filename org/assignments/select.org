This assignment is designed to test your understanding of the SELECT
command in SQLite, focusing on WHERE clauses, data types, operators,
and more. Please execute all queries against the provided test.db
database, which you can download from here: [[http://tinyurl.com/foods-sql][tinyurl.com/foods-sql]]

* Task 1: Basic WHERE clause usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Find all foods with an id of 5.
#+END_SRC

* Task 2: Using logical operators in WHERE clause
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Select all foods whose type_id is either 1 (Bakery) or 2 (Cereal).
#+END_SRC

* Task 3: String manipulation with WHERE clause
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Find foods whose names start with 'Ch' and contain 'e'.
#+END_SRC

* Task 4: Using arithmetic expressions in SELECT
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Display the name of each food along with its name length.
#+END_SRC

* Task 5: Employing the IN operator
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Select all foods whose type_id is either 3 (Chicken/Fowl) or 4 (Dairy).
#+END_SRC

* Task 6: Combining string functions and WHERE clause
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Select foods whose names end with 's' and are at least 5 characters long.
#+END_SRC

* Task 7: Exploring the ORDER BY clause
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- List all foods in ascending order of their type_id, and descending order of their names.
#+END_SRC

* Task 8: Using aggregate functions
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Find the average length of food names.
#+END_SRC

* Task 9: The GLOB pattern matching
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Select foods whose names start with 'P' and contain an 'e'.
#+END_SRC

* Task 10: Complex WHERE with logical and relational operators
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle test.db
  -- Find foods whose id is between 10 and 20 and are not of type_id 2 (Cereal).
#+END_SRC
